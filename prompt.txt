You're a professional Python developer with expertise in game development using Pygame.

Task: Write a complete, fully functional Python script for a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Pygame library. The implementation must include the following features:

üîπ Game Features
Game Board

Display a 3x3 grid rendered using Pygame to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

Player Turns

Clearly indicate the current player's turn (Player X or Player O).

Players take alternate turns by clicking on empty squares to place their mark.

Input Handling

Detect mouse clicks to determine which square was clicked.

Prevent players from selecting already occupied squares.

Win Detection

Detect if a player wins by having three of their marks aligned (row, column, or diagonal).

Show a clear message like "Player X Wins!" or "Player O Wins!".

Draw Detection

Detect if the board is full and there's no winner.

Display the message: "It's a Draw!".

Reset Functionality

Allow players to restart the game either by:

Pressing a key (e.g., 'R'), or

Clicking a ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù button on screen.

Graphics

Use simple shapes to draw the board and marks.

Ensure all visuals (grid, text, symbols) are clear, clean, and visually distinct using appropriate colors.

Game Loop

Implement a standard Pygame loop for handling events, updating the game state, and rendering visuals.

üîπ Requirements
The code should be well-structured, readable, and logically organized.

All required Pygame imports must be included.

The game must be fully runnable without external dependencies other than Pygame.
